# Hack-the-Gripper
Hack is a robotic arm that grabs objects on a pick, by using flex-tape. Objects are removed from pick, via a cup that the pick lifts into. Thus, Hack only needs three motors to grab and let go of objects in 3 dimensions.
Electronics are housed in a large tin soup can, which is zip-tied to a dumbbell.
